# Gender Friendly Adventures

### About
Gender Friendly Adventures is an ongoing project, started as a breakable toy (final project) at Launch Academy, Summer 2015 cohort.

### Goal
Gender Friendly Adventures was designed to give users more information on the gender-related aspects of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other venues, that isn't listed on existing review sites. This will help you be more informed before you decide to go to a new restaurant, so you can support venues that are all-gender inclusive, and spare yourself some headaches.
