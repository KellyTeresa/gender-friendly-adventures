### About
Gender Friendly Adventures (GFA) is an ongoing project, started as a breakable toy (final project) at Launch Academy, Summer 2015 cohort.

### Goal
Gender Friendly Adventures was designed to give users more information on the gender-related aspects of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other venues, that isn't listed on existing review sites. This will help you be more informed before you decide to go to a new restaurant, so you can support venues that are all-gender inclusive, and spare yourself some headaches.

### Technology
* Ruby on Rails app.
* Foundation front-end with custom SCSS.
* Google Maps API integration for venue locations.

When submitting a pull request, please include tests for any new models, views, helpers, etc! I use TDD, which you might not, but please create tests to maintain at least 95% coverage. I use Codeship and Coveralls to check my own work. Feel free to use whichever service you like best. I'll review PRs with happy green checkmarks of passing tests. :)
